    "It can be seen from the example that Bridgic can seamlessly schedule both asynchronous and synchronous workers within the same automa. Although `crawl_web_content` performs a blocking network request, Bridgic automatically dispatches it to a thread so that the event loop remains unblocked. Meanwhile, `analyze_web_content` runs asynchronously within the event loop. Refer to [`Worker`](../../../../reference/bridgic-core/bridgic/core/automa/worker/#bridgic.core.automa.worker.Worker) for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, Bridgic keeps an asynchronous-first design, but also provides built-in support for I/O-bound operations through its thread pool, ensuring smooth execution across different types of workloads."

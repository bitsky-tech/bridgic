Bridgic is an innovative programming framework designed to create agentic systems, from simple workflows to fully autonomous agents. Its APIs are thoughtfully crafted to be both simple and powerful.

## Core Features

* **Orchestration**: Bridgic helps to manage the control flow of your AI applications asynchronously.
* **Dynamic Control Flow**: Bridgic supports dynamic routing based on input data, and even allows workers to be added or removed at runtime.
* **Modularity**: In Bridgic, a complex agentic system can be composed by reusing components through hierarchical nesting.
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: A workflow or an agent built with Bridgic can request feedback from humans whenever needed.
* **Serialization**: Bridgic includes serialization, deserialization, and resuming capabilities to support human-in-the-loop.
* **Parameter Binding**: There are three ways to pass data among workers, including Arguments Mapping, Arguments Injection, and Inputs Propagation.
* **Systematic Integration**: A wide range of tools and LLMs can be seamlessly integrated into the Bridgic world, in a systematic way.
* **Customization**: What Bridgic provides is not a "black box" approach. You have full control over every aspect of your AI applications, such as prompts, context windows, the control flow, and more.

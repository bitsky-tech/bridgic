**Bridgic** is an innovative programming framework designed to create agentic systems, ranging from deterministic workflows to autonomous agents. It introduces a new paradigm that simplifies the development of agentic systems.

## Core Features

* **Orchestration**: Bridgic helps manage the execution flow of your AI applications by leveraging both predefined dependencies and dynamic routing.
* **Parameter Binding**: There are three ways to pass data among workers—Arguments Mapping, Arguments Injection, and Inputs Propagation—thereby eliminating the complexity of global state management.
* **Dynamic Routing**: Bridgic enables conditional branching and intelligent decision-making through an easy-to-use `ferry_to()` API that adapts to runtime dynamics.
* **Dynamic Topology**: The topology can be changed at runtime in Bridgic to support highly autonomous AI applications.
* **Modularity**: In Bridgic, a complex agentic system can be composed by reusing components through hierarchical nesting.
* **Human-in-the-Loop**: A Bridgic-style agentic system can request feedback from human whenever needed to dynamically adjust its execution logic.
* **Serialization**: Bridgic employs a scalable serialization and deserialization mechanism to achieve state persistence and recovery, enabling human-in-the-loop in long-running AI systems.
* **Systematic Integration**: A wide range of tools and LLMs can be seamlessly integrated into the Bridgic world, in a systematic way.
* **Customization**: What Bridgic provides is not a "black box" approach. You have full control over every aspect of your AI applications, such as prompts, context windows, the control flow, and more.

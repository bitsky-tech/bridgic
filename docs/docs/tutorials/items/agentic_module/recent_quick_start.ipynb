        "# ReCentAutoma\n",
        "\n",
        "ReCentAutoma is an agentic module implementation in Bridgic that provides a goal-oriented, guidance-enabled long-running autonomous agent. It enables developers to build intelligent systems that can autonomously plan and execute multi-step tasks using tools, with built-in memory management and goal tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "ReCentAutoma serves as a specialized agentic module in Bridgic, designed to provide a goal-oriented, guidance-enabled implementation for long-running autonomous agents. It addresses the fundamental challenges of building intelligent systems that can autonomously plan, execute, and adapt over extended interactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use ReCentAutoma\n",
        "\n",
        "ReCentAutoma is suitable when you need to build a module that possesses autonomy and the ability to use tools. In many cases, developers also require:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficient memory management**: As tasks span multiple steps and tool calls, conversation history grows. ReCentAutoma's built-in ReCENT memory algorithm automatically compresses history when needed, preventing context explosion.\n",
        "- **Natural language goal definition and guidance constraints**: ReCentAutoma accepts `goal` and optional `guidance` as first-class inputs, allowing you to define objectives and constraints in natural language, which are then used throughout the execution to prevent goal drift.\n",
        "\n",
        "These capabilities are well-supported in ReCentAutoma, making it ideal for building autonomous agents that need to:\n",
        "- Dynamically select and use tools based on runtime decisions\n",
        "- Handle long-running tasks with many interactions\n",
        "- Maintain focus on the original goal throughout execution\n",
        "- Manage context efficiently without manual intervention\n",
        "\n",
        "### How Does ReCentAutoma Work\n",
        "\n",
        "ReCentAutoma leverages GraphAutoma's core features—dynamic topology and dynamic routing—to implement an enhanced ReAct loop. It incorporates the innovative ReCENT (Recursive Compressed Episodic Node Tree) memory management algorithm, which triggers memory compression when necessary, effectively addressing two long-standing challenges in autonomous agents:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Context Explosion**: As conversation history grows linearly, the context window eventually overflows. ReCENT automatically compresses episodic memory when thresholds are reached, maintaining a compact yet informative context.\n",
        "- **Goal Drift**: Without explicit goal management, agents tend to deviate from original objectives during extended execution. ReCentAutoma maintains goal and guidance as persistent, non-compressible nodes, ensuring the agent stays focused on the original task.\n",
        "\n",
        "The execution flow follows an enhanced ReAct pattern:\n",
        "1. **Initialize**: Create a goal node with the task objective and optional guidance\n",
        "2. **Observe**: Evaluate the current state and determine if the goal has been achieved\n",
        "3. **Select Tools**: If the goal is not achieved, the LLM selects appropriate tools from the available set\n",
        "4. **Execute**: Dynamically created tool workers execute the selected tools concurrently\n",
        "5. **Collect**: Results are collected and added to memory\n",
        "6. **Compress** (when needed): Memory compression is triggered based on node count or token thresholds\n",
        "7. **Iterate**: The process repeats until the goal is achieved or stop conditions are met\n",
        "8. **Finalize**: Generate a comprehensive answer based on the accumulated context"

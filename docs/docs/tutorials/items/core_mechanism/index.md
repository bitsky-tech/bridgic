# Core Mechanism

Bridgic lets you build agentic systems by breaking down your workflows into modular building blocks called worker. Each worker represents a specific task or behavior, making it easy to organize complex processes.

Bridgic introduces clear abstractions for structuring flows, passing data between execution units, handling concurrency, and enabling dynamic control logic (such as conditional branching and routing). This design allows users to build systerm that scale efficiently from simple workflows to sophisticated agentic systems.

Key features include:

- **Concurrency Management**: Effortlessly manage parallel and sequential execution of logic blocks.
- **Parameter Binding and Data Flow**: Flexible mechanisms for passing information and mapping arguments between components.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Intuitive support for dynamic, context-sensitive execution paths and decision-making.
- **Modularity**: Reuse and compose workflow components for maintainable and extendable solutions.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Native support for seamlessly incorporating human feedback and decision-making into your workflows, allowing humans to interact, intervene, or collaborate with autonomous agents at key points in the execution flow.

This architectural foundation makes Bridgic a powerful platform for building agentic systems that are robust, adaptive, and easy to reason about, enabling you to bridge logic with the creative potential of AI.

    "\n",
    "When building workflows or agents with Bridgic, developers can seamlessly integrate human-in-the-loop interactions into the execution flow. At any point, the system can pause its automated process to request human input — such as approval, verification, or additional instructions — and wait for a response. Once the human feedback is provided, the workflow or agent resumes execution from the point of interruption, adapting its behavior based on the new input. Bridgic ensures that the entire process, including paused and resumed states, can be reliably serialized and deserialized for persistence and recovery.\n",

    "### Using a MCP Tool as a Worker\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP tools can be converted to Bridgic workers and integrated into `GraphAutoma` building. This allows you to orchestrate MCP tool calls alongside other workers in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why don't we just run the tool directly, but instead execute it as a worker? In Bridgic's view, every execution process in a workflow program (or an even more agentic system) can be decomposed into fine-grained workers, which can then be orchestrated and scheduled. Standardizing the execution process in this way simplifies development and debugging, and enhances observability during execution. Currently, too many frameworks separate agent operation from programmable orchestration, causing tools and developer-defined work units to hold unequal positions. This leads to two very different development and debugging experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of Bridgic, a tool is a worker: both are work units with clearly defined inputs and expected outputs, which are connected together, either due to predefined conditions or runtime ones, to accomplish more complex and bigger tasks.\n",

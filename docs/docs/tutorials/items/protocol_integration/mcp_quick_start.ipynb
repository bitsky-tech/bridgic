        "\n",
        "MCP tools can be converted to Bridgic workers and integrated into `GraphAutoma` building. This allows you to orchestrate MCP tool calls alongside other workers in your application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why don't we just run the tool directly, but instead execute it as a worker? In Bridgic's view, every execution process in a workflow program (or an even more agentic system) can be decomposed into fine-grained workers, which can then be orchestrated and scheduled. Standardizing the execution process in this way simplifies development and debugging, and enhances observability during execution. Currently, too many frameworks separate agent operation from programmable orchestration, causing tools and developer-defined work units to hold unequal positions. This leads to two very different development and debugging experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Bridgic, tools have distinct specifications, but all tool executions are carried out by converting them into workers. This approach standardizes different kinds of tools as uniform and orchestratable units, facilitating their integration and scheduling alongside other workers to accomplish more complex tasks.\n",

        "\n",
        "The lifecycle of an MCP server connection is **independent** from the execution of an automa: neither `interact_with_human()` (which pauses and raises `InteractionException`) nor `arun()` / `arun(feedback_data=...)` (which runs or resumes the automa) affects the connection. Once a connection is established and managed by a connection manager, it remains open until you close it.\n",
        "\n",
        "A practical implication is that **one connection can serve many executions**, which is important for the development of application. The automa may pause at `interact_with_human()` and be resumed later with `arun(feedback_data=...)`; each cycle can use MCP tools over the **same** connection without reconnecting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The following example demonstrates a simple CLI loop: in each turn, the automa requests a human command (interrupt), the application provides the command as feedback (resume), the automa executes the CLI MCP tool, and then requests for the next command—repeating this process to simulate user's multi-turn input. Across all these turns, the connection to the CLI MCP server is created only once (in the previous cell) and reused each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please note that this example specifically simulates multi-turn human–computer interactions by mimicking user command input; in real-world development, developers are free to customize their own human-in-the-loop interaction flow as needed."

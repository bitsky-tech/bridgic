    "> Note: Data declaration arguments injection is equivalent to assigning a default value to a certain parameter of a function, which is dynamically injected at runtime. For example: `c = worker3 *Data(y=From('a'))` is equivalent to `async def worker3(x: int, y: int = From('a'))`. This means that you cannot write `c = worker3 *Data(x=From('a'))`, because it is equivalent to `async def worker3(x: int = From('a'), y: int)`, This violates Python’s rule that parameters with default values cannot precede parameters without default values in a function signature."

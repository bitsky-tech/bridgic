# Tutorials

Welcome to the Bridgic tutorial! Here, we offer a complete learning the usage of "bridgic", helping you quickly master the core concepts and best practices of the framework.

Each feature will be accompanied by a simplified small process that might be encountered in the actual development process to help understand and recognize it.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll assume that Bridgic is already installed on your system. If thatâ€™s not the case, see Installation guide: [Bridgic Install](install.md).

This tutorial will walk you through these tasks:

1. [Quick Start](./notebooks/quick_start.ipynb): Write the first project with Bridgic.
2. [Model Usage](./notebooks/model_usage.ipynb): Use model in Bridgic.
3. [Dual-Mode Worker Execution](./notebooks/dual_mode_worker_execution.ipynb): Support for sync and async.
4. [Parameter Passing](./notebooks/parameter_passing.ipynb): Three ways of data transmission in Bridgic, including Arguments Mapping, Arguments Injection,  Inputs Propagation.
5. [Dynamic Router](./notebooks/dynamic_router.ipynb): Dynamically determine the next execution worker at runtime.
6. [Interaction Event](./notebooks/interaction_event.ipynb): Interaction with the external environment during operation.
7. [Nested Reuse](./notebooks/nested_reuse.ipynb): Reusing one Automa within another Automa.
<!-- 3. [Dynamic DAG](dynamic_dag.ipynb): Dynamically add or remove worker to change the execution DAG at runtime. -->

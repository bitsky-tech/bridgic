# Tutorials

Welcome to the Bridgic tutorial!

Here, we offer the basic knowledge for developing agentic system in Bridgic framework, helping you quickly master necessary concepts and best practices of organizing program deterministic logic and non-deterministic model calls to build an agent.

For each feature, we provide a simplified example process inspired by real-world development scenarios to help you better understand and apply the concepts.

This tutorial will walk you through these tasks:

1. [Quick Start](./items/quick_start/quick_start.ipynb): Write your first Bridgic style program.
2. [Core Mechanism](./items/core_mechanism/index.md): Learn about the core mechanism and how Bridgic organizes program into modular building blocks.
3. [Model Integration](./items/model_integration/index.md): Discover how to incorporate AI models into your workflows for creating more autonomous and intelligent systems.

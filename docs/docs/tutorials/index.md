# Tutorials

Welcome to the Bridgic tutorial! Here, we offer a complete learning the usage of Bridgic, helping you quickly master the core concepts and best practices of the framework.

Each feature will be accompanied by a simplified small process that might be encountered in the actual development process to help understand and recognize it.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll assume that Bridgic is already installed on your system. If thatâ€™s not the case, see Installation guide: [Bridgic Install](install.md).

This tutorial will walk you through these tasks:

1. [Quick Start](./notebooks/quick_start.ipynb): Write the first project with Bridgic.
2. [Model Usage](./notebooks/model_usage.ipynb): Use model in Bridgic.
3. [Concurrency Mode](./notebooks/concurrency_mode.ipynb): The support of concurrency in Bridgic.
4. [Parameter Binding Mechanism](./notebooks/parameter_binding_mechanism.ipynb): Three ways of data transmission in Bridgic, including Arguments Mapping, Arguments Injection,  Inputs Propagation.
5. [Routing](./notebooks/routing.ipynb): Dynamically determine the next execution worker at runtime.
6. [Human-in-the-loop](./notebooks/human_in_the_loop.ipynb): Interaction with the external environment during operation.
7. [Modularization](./notebooks/modularization.ipynb): Reusing one Automa within another Automa.
<!-- 3. [Dynamic DAG](dynamic_dag.ipynb): Dynamically add or remove worker to change the execution DAG at runtime. -->

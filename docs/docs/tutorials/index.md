# Tutorial

Welcome to the Bridgic tutorial! Here, we offer a complete learning the usage of "bridgic", helping you quickly master the core concepts and best practices of the framework.

Each feature will be accompanied by a simplified small process that might be encountered in the actual development process to help understand and recognize it.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll assume that Bridgic is already installed on your system. If thatâ€™s not the case, see Installation guide: [Bridgic Install](../home/installation.md#installation).

This tutorial will walk you through these tasks:

1. [Logic Arrangement](logic_arrangement.ipynb): Write the logic arragenment using Bridgic.
2. [model_usage](llm.ipynb): Use model in Bridgic.
2. [Parameter Passing](parameter_passing.ipynb): Three ways of data transmission in Bridgic, including Arguments Mapping, Arguments Injection,  Inputs Propagation.
3. [Dynamic Router](dynamic_router.ipynb): Dynamically determine the next execution worker at runtime.
<!-- 3. [Dynamic DAG](dynamic_dag.ipynb): Dynamically add or remove worker to change the execution DAG at runtime. -->

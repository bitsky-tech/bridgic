# Tutorials

Welcome to the Bridgic tutorial!

Here, we demonstrate the foundational concepts for developing agentic systems using the Bridgic framework, helping you quickly grasp the key ideas and best practices. For each core feature, we provide a concise example inspired by real-world development scenarios to make the concepts easier to understand and apply.

This tutorial will walk you through these tasks:

1. [Quick Start](./items/quick_start/quick_start.ipynb): Write your first Bridgic-style program.
2. [Core Mechanism](./items/core_mechanism/index.md): Learn about the core mechanism and how Bridgic organizes program into modular building blocks.
3. [Model Integration](./items/model_integration/index.md): Discover how to incorporate AI models into your workflows for creating more autonomous and intelligent systems.

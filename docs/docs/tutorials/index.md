# Tutorials

Welcome to the Bridgic tutorial!

Here, we offer the basic knowledge for developing agentic system in Bridgic framework, helping you quickly master necessary concepts and best practices of organizing program deterministic logic and non-deterministic model calls to build an agent.

For each feature, we provide a simplified example process inspired by real-world development scenarios to help you better understand and apply the concepts.

In this tutorial, we assume that Bridgic is already installed on your system. If thatâ€™s not the case, see [Bridgic Install](install.md).

This tutorial will walk you through these tasks:

1. [Quick Start](./items/quick_start/quick_start.ipynb): Write your first Bridgic style program.
2. [Concurrency Mode](./items/core_mechanism/concurrency_mode.ipynb): Organize your concurrent execution units systematically and conveniently.
3. [Parameter Binding](./items/core_mechanism/parameter_binding.ipynb): Explore three ways for passing data between execution units, including Arguments Mapping, Arguments Injection, and Inputs Propagation.
4. [Dynamic Routing](./items/core_mechanism/dynamic_routing.ipynb): Decide which execution unit to be executed in the short future dynamically.
5. [Modularity](./items/core_mechanism/modularity.ipynb): Reuse and compose Automata by embedding one inside another for scalable workflows.
6. [Model Integration](./items/model_integration/llm_integration.ipynb): Incorporate model to building a program with more autonomous capabilities.
7. [Human-in-the-loop](./items/core_mechanism/human_in_the_loop.ipynb): Enable human interaction or external input during workflow execution.

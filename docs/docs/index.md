# Welcome to the world of Bridgic!

**Bridgic** is an agentic programming framework built around a novel **dynamic topology** orchestration model and a **component-oriented paradigm** that is realized through **ASL (Agent Structure Language)**—a powerful declarative DSL for composing, reusing, and nesting agentic structures. Together, these elements make it possible to develop the entire spectrum of agentic systems, ranging from deterministic workflows to autonomous agents.

## What does the word "*Bridgic*" mean?

The name **Bridgic** is inspired by the idea of “**bridging logic and magic**” — bringing together the precision of logic and the creativity of intelligence.

- **Logic** stands for deterministic execution flows.
- **Magic** stands for highly autonomous AI agents.

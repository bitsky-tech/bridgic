# Welcome to the world of Bridgic!

**Bridgic** is an innovative programming framework designed to create agentic systems, ranging from deterministic workflows to autonomous agents. It introduces a new paradigm that simplifies the development of agentic systems.

## What does the word "*Bridgic*" mean?

The name **Bridgic** is inspired by the idea of “**bridging logic and magic**” — bringing together the precision of logic and the creativity of intelligence.

- **Logic** stands for deterministic execution flows.

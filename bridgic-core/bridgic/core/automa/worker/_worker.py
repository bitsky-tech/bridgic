    """
    This class is the base class for all workers.

    `Worker` has two methods that may be overridden by the subclass:

    1. `arun()`: This asynchronous method should be implemented when your worker 
    does not require almost immediately scheduling after all its task dependencies 
    are fulfilled, and when overall workflow is not sensitive to the fair sharing 
    of CPU resources between workers. If workers can afford to retain and occupy 
    execution resources for their entire execution duration, and there is no 
    explicit need for fair CPU time-sharing or timely scheduling, you should 
    implement `arun()` and allow workers to run to completion as cooperative tasks 
    within the event loop.

    2. `run()`: This synchronous method should be implemented when either of the 
    following holds:

        - a. The automa includes other workers that require timely access to CPU 
        resources (for example, workers that must respond quickly or are sensitive 
        to scheduling latency).

        - b. The current worker itself should be scheduled as soon as all its task 
        dependencies are met, to maintain overall workflow responsiveness. In these 
        cases, `run()` enables the framework to offload your worker to a thread pool, 
        ensuring that CPU time is shared fairly among all such workers and the event 
        loop remains responsive.

    In summary, if you are unsure whether your task require quickly scheduling or not, 
    it is recommended to implement the `arun()` method. Otherwise, implement the 
    `run()` **ONLY** if you are certain that you agree to share CPU time slices 
    with other workers.
